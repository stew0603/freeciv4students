<h2>FreeCiv and Math</h2>



</p>When it comes to persuasive writing are there any higher stakes than international diplomacy? When students start playing head-to-head that‚Äôs when Peace Treaty writing can run into double-digit page numbers. Where is the line drawn on borders? How much gold will be paid? What will happen to those who break the treaty?</p>

</p>This is just one of the many exciting ways reading and writing can be used in tandem with FreeCiv, but it is far from the only way. Students can write historical fiction using their civilization, its terrain and events in the game as a backdrop.</p> 

</p>Students can research (and create) new units, using their research to determine what kinds of technology are needed to develop the unit, how powerful it should be, and more.</p>

</p>Finally, as mentioned in the Social Studies section, reading can teach students (players) lessons from history, like why fighting in the jungle is so difficult for the attacker. Or how Communism gained such popularity in post-colonial and post-conflict nations. These kinds of readings can then lead to additional writing opportunities, like critiquing the game or proposing scenarios that accurately reflect reality. For example, ‚ÄúDoes Communism Really Eliminate Corruption?‚Äù</p>
