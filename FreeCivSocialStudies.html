<h2>FreeCiv and Social Studies</h2>


</p>
FreeCiv teaches many lessons, the greatest of this is that history is not a random set of coincidences--that historical events to a certain extent are predictable events. For example, the British and Japanese empires and accompanying navies are a necessity born out of the limited resources of an island. Additionally, FreeCiv teaches players about the value of natural resources and why cities are located where they are and do what they do. New York, Shanghai and London are all located where major rivers meet massive oceans. The resulting trade relationships both inland and abroad have led these cities to be both massive and massively important. Government types give students additional abilities (and restrictions) helping students to understand the benefits of a democracy (as well as the allure of more authoritarian forms).</p>

</p></p>Ultimately, FreeCiv is never going to teach students dates or major events. Instead, it will help students understand the more fundamental and interesting aspects of humanity--history, geography, politics, science and natural resources.</p>

</p>FreeCiv can become a way to explore historical events (through scenarios, for example) and learn the lessons history is meant to teach us. For example, in the game runaway pollution will cause desertification in some areas and rising sea levels in others. Sound familiar? It should. Itâ€™s what global warming is and will do the world. How do you stop it? Students must read to find out. Are you trying to defend your civilization from a larger invading army? What can the famous Battle of Thermopylae teach us about advantageous terrain. Is trading with neighboring cities taking too long? How did Native and French fur traders move efficiently without roads? Read to find out and then use this knowledge to improve in-game!</p>

</p>Here are some articles that teach valuable lessons!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.ancient.eu/thermopylae/">Battle of Thermopylae: The Strategic Value of Mountains</a></h2></h2>

<h2><a href="http://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling/learn/fur-trade">Rivers and the Fur Trade: Lessons in Trading and Fort Building </a></h2></h2>

<h2><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/fertile-crescent/">Building Your First City: Lessons from the Fertile Crescent  </a></h2></h2>

In addition, students are bound to become interested in the units, buildings, technologies and World Wonders available in the game. When this happens there are fantastic articles and lively discussions available all over the internet. Two of the best are at <a href="https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page">FreeCiv Fandom</a> and <a href="https://www.civfanatics.com/civ2/strategy/">CivFanatics</a>. As mentioned elsewhere on the site, FreeCiv is based on Civilization 2, so almost any article on Civ 2 can be applied to FreeCiv.
